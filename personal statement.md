My name is Zhangyu Ye, currently living in shenzhen.

Its my pleasure to take this interview. Thanks for this great opportunity.

I worked as frontend developer for 2 year after I graduated from University at Albany. My majors are Physics and Computer Science. 

I tried several different works in the past year. Like salesman,video editor, delivery, labor work. But none of them gives me the joy that coding can offer. I still like to convert a great design into a working products. Learning the latest tech gives me a sense of accomplishment , if I can apply the technology I learn on the daily working basis that is even better.
